## Overview
I created a **Hummingbird Robot** that can detect obstacles and respond intelligently.  
The robot is programmed using **JavaScript**, and its key feature is the ability to stop and change its direction whenever it encounters an object in front of it. While navigating, the **position motors** continue to operate smoothly, ensuring continuous movement during direction changes.

## Features
- Obstacle detection and response  
- Automatic stopping and direction change when an object is detected  
- Continuous movement of position motors during operation  
- Programmed entirely in JavaScript  

## Requirements
- Hummingbird Robotics Kit  
- JavaScript environment (Node.js or supported IDE)  
- Hummingbird driver/library for motor and sensor control  

## How It Works
1. The robot uses sensors to detect if there is an object in front of it.  
2. When an obstacle is detected, it stops and changes direction.  
3. Position motors continue to function, allowing smooth transitions and movement.  

## Future Improvements
- Enhance obstacle detection accuracy  
- Add path optimization for efficient navigation  
- Integrate additional sensors for more complex environments
